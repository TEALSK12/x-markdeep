Test 2 Guide
====================================================================================================

As written, the test for this unit is probably too long for students to complete in one class
period. Extra questions have been included so you can:

1. Pick and choose which questions will appropriately assess your students.
2. Create different versions of the test (if you’ve noticed that cheating is a problem).
3. Simulate an authentic AP test experience.

When modifying the test to suit your students, don’t forget to:

1. Change the headings on Section I & II to reflect the actual number of questions.
2. Change the headings on Section I & II to reflect the correct percentages of their total test
   score. The AP exam weights Section I & II at 50% of the overall score, each.
3. Adjust the test pacing for your class period’s time span. The ultimate goal is to work your
   students up to a pace of 2 minutes per Section I question, and 26 minutes per Section II question
   (including time for checking).
