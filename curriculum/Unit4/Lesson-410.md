Procedure
---------

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Review of Student Questions \[30 minutes\]

1. Clearly indicate that you expect all students to have a list of review topics to study this
   evening. Periodically remind students that this list will be checked at the end of class.

2. Begin with a review of student-submitted questions before reviewing the practice questions.

### Sample Test Review \[15 minutes\]

1. Begin review with practice test WS 4.10. Have students work through section I questions, then
   review the answers as a class.

2. Give students time to complete section II questions, then review the answers as a class.

3. Finally, work through the various review topics, prioritizing questions that popped up the most.

   - Some questions you may address while working through the sample test.

   - Be ready for additional questions to pop up as you go. Save yourself the work and use old
     homework questions and student-generated test questions as examples to work through.

4. Use a combination of group-solving questions on the whiteboard, think-pair-share, and
   timed-response as review strategies.

5. After you’ve completed reviewing an idea, remind the class that they should write down that topic
   if they feel they still have to review it tonight.

### Check Student Study Lists \[5 minutes\]
Spend the last 5 minutes of class checking each student’s review topic list.
