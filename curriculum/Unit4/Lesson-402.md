Procedure
---------
As with yesterday’s class, divide your class into small groups, and have the manipulatives out at
each group station, desk, or workspace. Offer a just-in-time intro to for-each loops, but do not get
bogged down in the introductory lesson. Many students will learn from physically practicing the
for-each control structure using the array whiteboards. Circulate around the room to check for
understanding, but let students help and challenge each other.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction to Arrays \[10 minutes\]

1. Briefly introduce the **for-each loop**, **array initialization**, and the **Arrays class**
   before dismissing the class to work on their group activity:

   If you want to access each element in the array without changing the values (to summarize or
   count them), you can access them using a for-each loop:

   ``` Java
   for (<type> <name> : <array>){
       <statement>;
       <statement>;
       …
   }
   ```

2. Place an array on the board, demonstrating the quick way to declare an array, and then illustrate
   how a for-each loop could be used to access the array:

   ``` Java
   int[] fallTemperatures = {55, 50, 59, 69, 48, 30, 48};
   ```

   - This initializes an array called fallTemperatures with 7 integer values. Ask students when they
     might see these temperatures in their region, and how the values in the array would differ
     during another season or in a different location. It may make sense in your region to change
     the array name to winterTemperatures or nightTimeTemperatures, etc.

     ``` Java
     for (int i = 0; i < fallTemperatures.length; i++) {
         if (fallTemperatures[i] > 32) {
             above++;
         }
     }
     ```

   - This is our traditional loop, which traverses the array and sums up all the temperatures that
     are above freezing (we assume there is a method called “above” that keeps a running count of
     how many days were above 32 degrees). We can express this same process with a for-each loop:

     ``` Java
     for (int i : fallTemperatures) {
         if (i > 32) {
             above++;
         }
     }
     ```

     with the general form of:

     ``` Java
     for (<type> <name> : <array>) {
         <statement>;
         <statement>;
         …
     }
     ```

   - Make a point of having your students write a note to remind themselves that for-each loops
     cannot modify values within an array, only examine each value in sequence.

### Student Array Activity \[35 minutes\]

1. Distribute white boards and markers or paper printouts to group workstations before students get
   seated.

2. If you feel that your students need the additional structure, assign groups to work together.

3. If you think students will need the extra guidance, help students together in a whole-group
   setting. To help students without giving them the answer outright, point out that:

   a. `numbers[7]` evaluates to `0`.

   b. `numbers[numbers[7]]` → `numbers[0]` does NOT evaluate to 0.

   c. Instead, the memory location `numbers[0]` (the index 0 of the numbers array) receives a value.

4. Walk around the room, spot-checking for student understanding and answering any student
   questions.

### Paper Selection & Grade Announcement \[5 minutes\]
At the end of class, consider choosing one group’s whiteboard to evaluate as a demonstration for the
class.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
If you have a student that would benefit from additional tactile or visiospatial learning exercises,
invite him or her to create a classroom poster that contains the same information as Poster 4.2.

Rather than assigning groups randomly or by ability, use tiered grouping as a differentiation
strategy. Concepts/skills will be covered at different levels of complexity in response to diagnosed
needs of each learner. Your tiered group assignments will probably end up changing from one exercise
to another, since students’ needs and strengths vary with instructional objectives and task types.
