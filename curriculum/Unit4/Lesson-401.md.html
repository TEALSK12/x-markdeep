Procedure
---------
Divide your class into small groups today, and have the manipulatives (see below) out at each group
station, desk, or workspace. Offer a just-in-time intro to arrays as outlined below, but don’t
belabor instruction; students may have better success physically working through the activity.
Circulate around the room to check for understanding, but let students help and challenge each
other.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction to Arrays \[20 minutes\]
1. Open up with the example of daily temperature on the slides.

   - Ask the class to build the program, they should reach the point where they calculate the
     average, but are unable to calculate the days above average as they must access the data a
     second time.

   - In order the successfully make the program, we would need to store the temperature for every
     day.

   - An array is an indexed structure that holds multiple values of the same type. Ask students if
     they’ve seen anything in Java that might be an array. (A String can be thought of as an array
     of characters!)

   - The values stored in an array are called elements. Individual elements are accessed using an
     integer index (the position). Ask students what element is stored at index 2, 4, and 7 in this
     string/array.

   - Since an array is an object, you have to construct it (you can’t just declare it as a
     variable).

     ``` Java
     int[] numbers = new int[10];
     ```

     _Nothing is in the highlighted brackets because you’re describing what type is going to be
     contained in the array._

     ``` Java
     int[] numbers = new int[10];
     ```

     _Here’s the name of your array—in this case we’re making an array of numbers._

     ``` Java
     int[] numbers = new int[10];
     ```

     _We use the* new *keyword since we’re constructing an object, then we tell Java how many
     elements we want to store in our array. In this case we want to store 10 numbers in the array._

     - Check for student understanding by asking students to tell you how to construct an array that
       holds 9 integers.

       ``` Java
       int[] numbers = new int[9];
       ```

     - Alternatively, you can initialize an array by writing out the full array.

       ``` Java
       int[] numbers = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
       ```

2. Both of these sample arrays are only ½ done right now—they’re arrays filled with 0s because Java
   auto-initializes arrays to a default value of 0 (for `char`, `double`, and `int`) or `false` (for
   boolean). So our *number* array looks something like this:

   ```
   .------------------.---.---.---.---.
   | array `numbers`: | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
   +------------------+---+---+---+---+
   |     index        | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   `------------------'---'---'---'---'
   ```

   - To fill in this array, we need to fill in the values for each location:

     ``` Java
     numbers[0] = 27;
     numbers[3] = -6;
     ```

   - Now the array looks like this:

   ```
   .------------------.---.---.---.---.
   | array `numbers`: | 27| 0 | 0 |-6 |
   +------------------+---+---+---+---+
   |     index        | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   `------------------'---'---'---'---'
   ```

3. Briefly touch on other types of arrays and common errors.

   - You can have arrays of almost anything: `String`, `double`, `boolean`, _etc._ Examples of an
     instantiated double and boolean array are on the slides. Ask the class what they must change to
     create these arrays.

   - Cover the common index-out-of-bounds exception. If the program calls illegal indexes or indexes
     outside 0 and the array’s length–1, Java will throw you an exception. (It’s always nice to go
     over reasons for exceptions so you don’t need to correct them all later!)

4. If you have a really big array, you can use a Scanner to grab values from user input, or you can
   autofill them with a loop:

   ``` Java
   for (int i = 0; i < age.length; i++){
       age[i] = input.nextInt();
   }
   ```

   As you move across the array (in this case to fill each element with a user-inputted value), we
   call this “array traversal.” You’ll need to do this a lot in the future, so you should put a
   general formula in your Tricky Code Cheat Sheet:

   ``` Java
   for (int i = 0; i < age.length; i++){
       // do something with age[i];
   }
   ```

### Student Array Activity \[25 minutes\]

1. Distribute white boards and markers to group workstations before students get seated.

2. If you feel that your students need the additional structure, assign groups to work together on
   Problem 2.

3. Walk around the room, spot-checking for student understanding and answering any student
   questions.

### Paper Selection & Grade Announcement \[5 minutes\]
At the end of class, consider choosing one group’s whiteboard to evaluate as a demonstration for the
class.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Rather than assigning groups randomly or by ability, use tiered grouping as a differentiation
strategy. Concepts/skills will be covered at different levels of complexity in response to diagnosed
needs of each learner. Your tiered group assignments will probably end up changing from one exercise
to another, since students’ needs and strengths vary with instructional objectives and task types.

You can reduce paper waste and increase student engagement by creating an inexpensive classroom set
of “array whiteboards” following these instructions:

1. Purchase panel board from your local hardware store (http://tinyurl.com/zgtlbhr)

2. Have the assistant cut the board into long strips that you can use as 1 dimensional arrays.

   1. If you like to use individual whiteboards to check for student understanding, you can have
      whiteboards cut to individual student squares, then have students line up the little white
      boards into a one-dimensional array for this exercise.

   2. If you plan on using these as array boards, you can either subdivide the boards into
      element-blocks with black electrical tape, or you can have your students draw the blocks in
      with their dry erase markers. (The latter option encourages students to construct arrays of
      different sizes.)

   3. Your total number of array white boards should be:

      (# small groups in your classroom) * 2 + 1 instructor array board

3. Use these array-whiteboards to demonstrate the relationship between 1 (and later 2) dimensional
   arrays during this unit.

In mathematics, a **manipulative** is an object which is designed so that a learner can perceive
some mathematical concept by manipulating it, hence its name. The use of manipulatives provides a
way for children to learn concepts in a developmentally appropriate, hands-on and experiential way.

Teacher Prior CS Knowledge
---------------------------
Arrays in Java (and other object oriented programming languages) are classes. This brings the whole
object oriented paradigm into play. When declaring an array variable, the variable is now a
reference to an array object. In order to create an object from a class the programmer uses the
`new` keyword. There is a distinction between the array reference and the array object. This
programming construct allows for multiple reference to point to the same object.


Common Mistakes
---------------
Arrays common mistakes:

Misconceptions
--------------
- Students understanding of the difference between the index `i` and the content of the
  i<sup>th</sup> element stored in `a[i]`.

- Loop bounds:
  + 0-based index arrays,
  + where arrays end, versus array length, and
  + what are the range of indices to express a particular array range.
