| Section                              | Total Time |
|--------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance             |       5min |
| Class discussion (if needed)         |      10min |
| Test review and reteach              |      35min |
| Check student notes and return tests |       5min |


Procedure
---------
Return student grades before class begins or while students are completing the bellwork.

Do not return students’ tests before the review session, since you want to motivate students to pay
attention to the entire review, taking supplemental notes the entire time.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Class Discussion (if needed) \[10 minutes\]

1. If grades are low, invite the class to a discussion of what can be improved. Begin with student
   complaints and suggestions to build student buy-in. Ask students:

   - how they felt they were going to do before the test
   - what surprised them once they were taking the test
   - what they felt worked in the first unit (lessons, review strategies, assignments)
   - what do they think they want to change for the second unit

2. Once you feel that a dialogue has been established, validate students’ feelings, then challenge
   them (e.g. AP courses are stressful, but this is good practice for college, where the pace is
   faster and professors don’t give personalized instruction).

### Test Review and Reteach \[30 minutes\]

1. Walk the students through each question on the test, glossing over questions that everyone
   answered correctly.

   a. You can ask for students to volunteer answers, or call on students randomly. Make sure that
      students explain their logic when they answer. If a student gives an incorrect answer, the
      explanation will tell you what you need to re-teach or clarify.

   b. Do not skip questions that everyone answered correctly, but do not spend more than the time it
      takes to read the question, and congratulate students’ correct answers.

2. Project a copy of each question as you review—this will help students recall the question/process
   the information.

3. Make sure that students are taking notes during the re-teach, reminding students that for
   homework, they will have an opportunity to win back some of the points on their exam.

4. For Section II questions, select a sample of student work (with any identifying information
   obscured), and work through the answer together as a class.

### Check student notes and return tests \[5 minutes\]
At the end of class, check student notes, and return the tests in hard copy form if applicable.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Encourage advanced students to take on additional programming challenges. One easy way to do this is
to assign Programming Projects from the blue pages at the end of each Chapter.

If you have a few students that are struggling with the class, choose these students to create your
classroom posters after school or for extra credit.
