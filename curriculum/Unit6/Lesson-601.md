Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer** (if you are able to/opt to use Eclipse with your students)
- **Whiteboard and** **markers**
- **Classroom copies** of [WS 6.1] Start class poster, [Example 6.1]
- **Pictures** of Pokémon (<http://tinyurl.com/l6mybmr>) or Pokémon Cards
- **Student pair assignments**
- **Art supplies** for each group:
  - Poster paper or cut sheets of butcher paper
  - Lined paper (at least 3 sheets per group)
  - Markers
  - Glue Sticks
  - Old magazines, flyers, newspapers to cut up for collage
  - Scissors
  - Yarn, string, or embroidery floss
  - Tape, magnets, or tacks to hang finished work

Most of the supplies required for this lesson are readily available in high schools. If the school
doesn’t have poster paper, butcher paper works well. Other supplies may be available to borrow from
the Math, Science, or Art teachers. To get an idea what a final student project should look like,
check out the picture of sample student work “Example 6.1.”

Procedure
---------
Hook your students by prominently displaying pictures or cards of Pokémon, art materials, and sample
work (of your own making, or saved from a previous year). To feature the most engaging student
examples, look for work that has many instances of each class, and uses classes/objects that are
popular with your class. Invoke an air of mystery and don’t offer an explanation for any of it.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction \[20 minutes\]

1. Have a class discussion about the Pokémon picture/cards. Ask a few probing questions to model the
   use of proper programming terminology as you have students work through a starter assignment:

2. Ask students what the picture is of. Do they know the names or types of the Pokémon featured?
   Assign a quick Think-Pair-Share assignment having the students creating the instance of that
   Pokémon. Here’s a sample prompt:

   “Create the object Pikachu. Pikachu should have a type, a level, and 2 methods.”

3. Show a few more cards/pictures. Ask students to do another Think-Pair-Share with another prompt
   to create another instance (your prompt should have whatever Pokémon you’ve just discussed):

   “Create the object Squirtle. Squirtle should have a type, a level, and 2 methods.”

4. Repeat this sequence one more time; showing the cards, and having students create a Pokémon
   instance object. Your students should be getting annoyed at having to write the same things over
   and over again.

5. Ask students what all of the Pokémon have in common. Encourage them to list additional traits
   other than the ones you’ve required them to include in your class exercises.

6. Ask students if they can think of a way to create new Pokémon objects without having to “reinvent
   the wheel” each time. (They might be able to sketch out an answer based on the previous night’s
   readings.)

7. Students might suggest subclasses of Pokémon, in which case you should point out that they’re
   creating a class that is included within the larger classification of “all Pokémon.”

   The individual Pokémon demonstrate an *instance of* the Pokémon class. Each *subclass* of
   Pokémon is a specialized version of the parent class (or *superclass*) Pokémon.

   #### Examples
   - An electric Pokémon is a Pokémon.
   - A computer science student is a student.
   - A math teacher is a teacher.
   - Soda is a drink.

   Have students describe the hierarchical structure of each relationship above. Electric Pokémon is
   a subclass, Pokémon is the superclass. Student is the superclass, computer science student is the
   subclass. Drink is the superclass, soda is the subclass.

8. Confirm understanding by asking for students to generate some examples. In each case, their two
   categories exhibit a hierarchical connection; one type is a specialized version of the other.

9. Ask students to define an inheritance hierarchy in their own words. Briefly discuss why you would
   want to use inheritance in programming.

   - An **inheritance hierarchy** is a set of hierarchical relationships between classes of objects.

   - **Inheritance** is a programming technique that allows a derived class to extend the
     functionality of a base class, inheriting all of its state and behavior.)

   - **Superclass** is the parent class in an inheritance relationship.

   - **Subclass, or child class** is the derived class in an inheritance relationship.

10. Check for understanding by returning to the examples above, and asking students to give an
   example of some characteristics (fields) the parent class would have, and what characteristics
   students would add to the specialized subclasses.

   _Example:_ Drinks could have a String *name* and boolean *carbonated*, and Soda could add a
   boolean *caffeinated*.

11. The class header for a subclass that extends the functionality of the parent class looks like
   this:

   ``` Java
   public class Mammal extends Animal {

   public class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {

   public class Churro extends Pastry {
   ```

   - Point out that the subclass names are capitalized by convention, and that you always use the
     *extends* keyword. Give students a moment to think of a few hierarchical relationships in a
     think-pair-share, and ask several volunteers to come to the front of the room to demonstrate
     the correct class header.

12. For the following example, we will create subclasses that extend the *Drink* superclass written
   below. If your students need additional practice building classes of objects, you can have them
   help you write this code. In more advanced classes, you may just reveal this class as a
   fully-formed starting point to demonstrate how to write subclasses.

   ``` Java
   public class Drink {
       private String  name;
       private boolean hasCarbonation;
       private double  gramsOfSugar;
       private double  ounces;

       public Drink (String n, Boolean h, double g) {
           name = n;
           hasCarbonation = h;
           gramsOfSugar = g;
           ounces = 8;           //FDA defines a serving as 8 oz.
       }

       public void chug (double gulp) {
           if (ounces < gulp) {
               throw new IllegalArgumentException ("Not enough " + name + " left.");
           } else {
               System.out.println ("Glug, glug, glug!");
               ounces -=gulp;
               System.out.println("You have " + ounces + "oz. of " + name + " left.");
           }
       }

       public String getState() {
           return "liquid";
       }

       public void printLabel() {
           System.out.println ("Enjoy refreshing " + name + " !");
       }
   }
   ```

13. Because the subclass is still a class, you should add fields and constructors, as you do with
   any class:

   ``` Java
   public class SugarFreeDrink extends Drink {
       private boolean hasSweetener;
       private double  caffeineContent;
   ```

   The additional fields `hasSweetener` and `caffeineContent` characterize all `SugarFreeDrink`
   `Drink` objects. You point out to students that `SugarFreeDrink` “is a kind of `Drink`.”
   Spot-check student understanding by asking if objects of the `Drink` superclass will initialize
   with a value for `hasSweetener` or `caffeineContent`. (_No_.)

14. `SugarFreeDrink` drinks still have a name, a boolean carbonation value, sugar content, and
   ounces, but we’ve added a new fields specifying whether or not the sugar free drinks have
   caffeine and artificial sweeteners. The constructor then looks like this:

   ``` Java
   public SugarFreeDrink(String name, boolean hasCarbonation, boolean h, double c) {
   ```

   - The fields in the subclass’ constructor now contain &lt;type&gt; &lt;superclass parameter
     values&gt; (highlighted), except for the new fields, which still have a formal parameter (in
     this case h and c).

   - To complete the constructor so it can access the fields you already wrote in the superclass,
     you use the keyword super:
     ``` Java
         // must be first line after constructor header
         super(name, hasCarbonation, 0.0);
     ```

   - Notice that we’ve initialized all objects in the *SugarFreeDrink* class to have 0.0 grams of
     sugar.

   - Complete the constructor with your subclass’ new fields:
     ```Java
         hasSweetener = h;
         caffieneContent = c;
     }
     ```

15. You can also add methods that only apply to your subclass, just the way you normally write
   object methods:

   ``` Java
   public void printWarningLabel() {
       if (hasSweetener) {
           System.out.println("This drink is not safe for Phenylketonurics.");
       } else {
           System.out.println("This drink contains no artificial sweeteners.");
       }
   }
   ```

### Review of the Project \[5 minutes\]
1. Briefly review the assignment with your students, reading the directions aloud if need be.

2. If you haven’t already distributed project materials at this point, do so while your students are
   rearranging into partner pairs.

### Student Work \[25 minutes\]
1. Encourage students to take 5–10 minutes on Step 1. They should review all steps of the project to
   ensure that their selection of classes lends itself to the project (e.g. they shouldn’t pick
   something they don’t know a lot about because they’ll have trouble coming up with fields and
   methods).

2. Offer time checks every 10 minutes so students can stay on pace. By the end of the first day,
   they should have gotten to step 6 or 7. Visit each group to make sure that they haven’t veered
   off course.

3. On **day two**, check student work and help students display their work around the room.

4. Check that the flow-of-control string (see WS 6.1 for explanation) correctly shows how a method
   is passed through subclasses to the superclass.

5. Remind students to take notes (Step 11 on WS 6.1) to help them remember talking points for later
   in the class.

6. As a whole group, ask students to volunteer what they really liked about others’ projects.
   Solicit questions and critiques, re-teaching if needed.

7. Administer quiz 6.1 to assess student understanding.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Encourage advanced students to add additional classes, fields, methods, and client code. If students
still have time to spare, encourage them to read on method overriding, and invite them to add that
code as well. Students can attach this “extra code” using paper and tape/glue or sticky notes.

If you have a few students that are struggling with the class, give them your starter Drink class
and SugarFree subclass, and let them build off of your examples. You can print out your starter code
and cut it into pieces and shuffle them so students have to place each line in the correct location
(as with a Parson problem).

If your students need further instruction on calling a superclass’ constructor, go through a few
more examples using the Drink superclass, or classes that you created as a whole group. One example
has been outlined below:

``` Java
public class SugarDrink extends Drink {
    private boolean isJuice;

    public SugarDrink (String name, boolean hasCarbonation, double gramsOfSugar,
                       double ounces, boolean iJ) {
        super(name, hasCarbonation, gramsOfSugar, ounces);
        isJuice = iJ;
    }
```


Teacher Prior CS Knowledge
--------------------------
- The Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm could be thought of as mimicking the real world
  where objects consists of data that define them and actions that can be performed on the data. As
  you will see, the process of learning OOP is infinitely more complex.

- The pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP): inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. In
  a nutshell inheritance allows for code reuse by defining methods once in a superclass,
  encapsulation provides data security by hiding data implementation from the user and only allowing
  methods in the class to modify the data, and polymorphism offers flexibility to the designer by
  way of methods defined in many forms.


Misconceptions
--------------
Students’ use of “inheritance” prior to computer science are in the context of inheritance from an
ancestor and genetic inheritance of traits. However, in computer science, inheritance is used for
classification where the class that inherits (extends) from a more general class (super class).
Neither of the students’ prior knowledge and use of inheritance is an accurate representation of
Java’s class structure.
