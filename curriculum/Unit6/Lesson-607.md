Procedure
---------
Students should complete the programming projects on their own. Read through the instructions with
the class, and help students pace themselves by setting progress goals for each day.

Before letting students begin the projects, ask students what resources are available to them so
they can help themselves before calling you over. (Notebooks, textbook, class handouts, student work
and posters hanging around the room, online resources.

### About Barron’s
- Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some schools provide students. If your school doesn’t
  provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
  codingbat.com/java or practice-it.

- Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as homework.

- If you’ve chosen to introduce TextExcel earlier, you can assign portions of TextExcel as homework
  here to save time later in the course. TextExcel like FracCalc takes a lot of in and out of class
  time to complete, and time saved here saves time for AP test review.

### Programming Projects

On the overhead or shared electronically, provide students with the following programming prompts:

#### Programming Project I

Write an inheritance hierarchy of three-dimensional shapes:

1. Make a top-level shape interface that has methods for getting information such as the volume and
   surface area of a three-dimensional shape.

2. Then make classes and subclasses that implement various shapes such as cubes, rectangular
   prisms, spheres, triangular prisms, cones, and cylinders.

3. Place common behavior in superclasses whenever possible, and use abstract classes as appropriate.

4. Add methods to the subclasses to represent the unique behavior of each three-dimensional shape,
   such as a method to get a sphere’s radius.

#### Programming Project II

Write an inheritance hierarchy that stores data about sports players.

1. Create a common superclass or interface to store information common to any player regardless of
   sport, such as name, number, and salary.

2. Then create subclasses for players of your favorite sports, such as basketball, soccer or tennis.

3. Place sport-specific information and behavior (such as kicking, vertical jump height, or speed)
   into subclasses whenever possible.

#### Programming Project III

Have students submit answers to Exercise 9.3 in their textbooks. This assignment will be submitted
on paper. As written, students are not given some code that implements GroceryBill, Employee, and
Item. If you wish to make this an electronic assignment, you should consider providing students with
some starter code.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In some classrooms, you may want to provide the mathematical formulas for finding the volume of
spheres, triangular prisms, cones, and cylinders so students can focus on coding rather than finding
and translating the math. You can also introduce and reinforce useful vocabulary by providing
physical examples of these shapes. If you are having trouble finding prisms, cones, and cylinders,
you can make these items out of paper by printing out templates and following the instructions at
this website: ([**http://tinyurl.com/asz6e69**](http://tinyurl.com/asz6e69))

To help students process Programming Project III, you may want to read through exercise 9.3 in the
textbook with the class, breaking down the problem into its parts as a whole group. In ELL
classrooms, you should bring in physical samples of grocery receipts and pass them around or view
them on the projector. Have students point out the different parts of the receipt as they relate to
the assignment.

Remind students to always draw a structure diagram, sketch out their plan using pseudocode, and
include comments to remind themselves (and you!) of what each section of code is for.
