Lesson 8.05 — Finding & Fixing Errors
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Find** errors in their returned homework assignments.
- **Correct** their code

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Re-submit** all homework assignments with corrected answers.

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Review** materials for the quiz by:
  - **Reviewing** all the blue pages at the end of Chapter 12 for sections 12.1 and 12.2
  - **Outline** Chapter 12 up to section 12.3
- **Submit** 2 questions for review in class tomorrow using electronic survey


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Any student homework assignments** that you have not yet returned
- **Student self-help system** (such as C2B4 or student pairing)
- **Electronic survey** for student review requests

The homework tonight asks students to submit 2 questions for review; the number is reduced for this
until since there is far less material than usual. Create an electronic survey for students to
complete with 3 text fields, one for name, and 2 for questions they have about Ch. 12 content. Set a
deadline by which time students must have submitted 2 questions from Ch. 12 If students do not have
questions, stipulate that they still have to submit something to receive credit, even if it is only
questions they think other students may have.

| Section                                | Total Time |
|----------------------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance               |       5min |
| Introduction and homework distribution |       5min |
| Student work                           |      35min |
| Students trade work, check, and submit |      10min |


Procedure
---------
Today we continue reinforcing concepts and applying the tools, procedures, and code that were
introduced earlier. Students will have the opportunity to correct any incorrect homework or
classwork assignments. It may be the case that students need to practice the modeling exercise from
the previous lesson. You should set up a section of the room for students to help each other model
code execution quietly.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Introduction and Homework Distribution \[5 minutes\]

1. Return student homework packets, or have students place their returned homeworks in a pile on
   their desk.

2. Collect the homework assignments from last night, and quickly grade them while students are
   working on their other assignments. Return those works back immediately so students can correct
   any errors.

   Some of the assignments from the night before may take a while to grade (especially exercise
   12.3). You may want to have students help you with the grading, or extend the classwork to
   homework. If you cannot grade 12.3 before the end of class, you might want to integrate this
   exercise into your test review session.

3. Explain to students that they have the opportunity to get full credit on their homework grades by
   correcting them now, in class. Ask students for suggestions/ideas on how to make sure they don’t
   miss any errors.

   By now students should be used to relying on their error checklist/algorithm.

### Student Work \[35 minutes\]

Have students work individually to correct their homework grades.

- Offer time checks for students so they stay on task.

- If students have not finished homework assignments, allow them time today to complete these
  assignments to turn in for partial credit.

### Students trade work, check, and turn in \[10 minutes\]
At the end of class, have students trade their homework assignments to evaluate each other’s
corrections before submission.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, pair students and allow them to work together to correct their work. If you
noticed a particular problem was difficult for the majority of students, read the question aloud and
help students work through it.

For those students who have nothing to correct (or finish very early), reward them with silent free
time, or allow them to work on a free-choice programming project.
