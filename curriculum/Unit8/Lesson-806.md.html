Lesson 8.06 — Review
====================================================================================================

Overview
--------
### Objectives — _Students will be able to…_
- **Identify** weaknesses in their Unit 8 knowledge.

### Assessments — _Students will…_
- **Complete** Quiz 8.5.

### Homework — _Students will…_
- **Read and highlight** Study for Quiz


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer**
- **Whiteboard and marker**
- **Results** from electronic survey of review topics


Once students have submitted their review requests, assemble those topics into categories and
prepare to re-teach the topics as needed. Rather than using an entire class period for a test, we’re
condensed the Chapter 12 topics into a quiz. This should allow you more time to start reviewing for
the AP exam.


Pacing Guide
------------
| Section                     | Total Time |
|-----------------------------|-----------:|
| Bell-work and attendance    |       5min |
| Review of student questions |      40min |


Procedure
---------
At the beginning of class today:

- Remind students that the quiz is at the end of class today.

- Review student-submitted questions.

### Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]

### Review of Student Questions \[30 minutes\]

1. Work through the various review topics, prioritizing questions that popped up the most.

   - Some questions you may address while working through the sample test.

   - Be ready for additional questions to pop up as you go. Save yourself the work and use old
     homework questions and student-generated test questions as examples to work through.

2. Use a combination of group-solving questions on the whiteboard, think-pair-share, and
   timed-response as review strategies.

3. After you’ve completed reviewing an idea, remind the class that they should write down that topic
   if they feel they still have to review it tonight.

### Check Student Study Lists \[5 minutes\]
Spend the last 5 minutes of class checking each student’s review topic list.


Accommodation & Differentiation
-------------------------------
The quiz features a recursive method to produce the Fibonacci sequence. If your students need extra
help/scaffolding, you might want to show students this YouTube video
(<https://youtu.be/dsmBRUCzS7k>) and lead a class discussion to ensure students are familiar with
the math involved.
