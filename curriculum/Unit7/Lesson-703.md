Materials & Prep
----------------
- ***Elevens* Lab Teacher’s Guide**
- **Classroom copies** of the *Elevens* Lab Student Guide
- **Associated *Elevens* Lab Activity Starter Code**

Read through the Teacher, Student, and Extension guides ahead of time to familiarize yourself with
the parts of this long-form lab. Using the guides, complete the lab on your own to spot possible
challenges for your students. Since later starter code packages include answers to the earlier
sections of the lab, we recommend that you ***do not*** upload all student files onto computer
desktops for student access. If possible, email *ActivityN Starter Code* to students the day of the
lab. Otherwise, upload files manually to each desktop before each class period.

Procedure
---------
All guides, sample code, answer code, and example code may be found in the folder “Milestone 3
Elevens Lab.”

1. To help students start the lab smoothly, start Activity 1 as a whole group.

2. Encourage students to use their Tricky Code Cheat Sheets, 4 Commandments of Scope, notebooks,
   textbooks, classroom posters, and homework assignments.

3. Offer occasional time-checks to help keep students on pace.

4. Grade notebooks and review books in between helping students so students can keep notebooks for
   homework and studying in the evenings.

### About Barron’s
Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some schools provide students. If your school doesn’t
provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
codingbat.com/java or practice-it.

Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as homework.

### Notes for Introduction Lecture for Activity 3

1. The teacher’s guide recommends leading the activity with a discussion on what makes a good
   shuffling algorithm.

   - The Collections class has a method called shuffle that accepts a list as its parameter, and
     rearranges its elements randomly:

     ``` Java
     Collections.shuffle(list);    // Where list is the name of the array you want to shuffle.
     ```

   - Ask students what `System.out.println` method they could call to get the top card (or first
     element) of the array.

     ``` Java
     System.out.println("Top card = " + list.get(0));
     ```


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
Each day that you begin the lab, start with a quick survey of student concerns and questions. As
needed, allow students to pair up to help each other with reading comprehension (but remind students
that they each must submit their own code).

- Adaptations for group work can be found on page 17 of the Teacher’s guide.

In ELL classrooms, read all directions aloud before breaking into individual practice, and allow up
to twice the amount of time for completion of the lab.

- To save time on the lab, skip lessons marked as optional.

Encourage advanced students to work through the optional lab activities. Otherwise, these students
can serve as student TAs, helping others when they get stuck on code. Remind student TAs not to give
answers directly, but to ask leading questions and modeling solutions to similar problems.
