- **A list of homework assignments is provided below. **


Materials & Prep
----------------
- **Projector and computer**
- **Picture Lab** Teacher’s Guide
- **Classroom copies** of the Picture Lab Student Guide
- **Associated Picture Lab & Picture Lab Extension** Files
- **Digital camera** (**optional**)
- **CD** (**optional**)
- **Egg cartons and small candies** (Skittles or M&Ms) (**optional**)
- **Photo negative** (**optional**)
- **Rectangular mirror** (**optional**)

Read through the Teacher, Student, and Extension guides ahead of time to familiarize yourself with
the parts of this long-form lab. Using the guides, complete the lab on your own to spot possible
challenges for your students. Upload all student files onto each computer desktop for student
access. Don’t give the finalClasses folder to your students—it contains sample answers!

**NOTE**: If your students enter the classroom with prior programming knowledge, or if your class is
moving through the AP course quickly with ease, you may want to deliver the Text Excel lab (included
in Unit 5 materials) instead.

About Barron’s
--------------
- Barron’s is an AP CS A review book that some school provide students. If your school doesn’t
  provide Barron’s there are many alternative homework assignments that can be found at
  http://codingbat.com/java (no classes) or practice-it.

- Alternatively, you can save time spent on the lab by checking activities as Homework.


Procedure
---------
All guides, sample code, answer code, and example code may be found in the folder “Milestone 2
Picture Lab.”

1. To help students start the lab smoothly, start Activity 1 as a whole group.

2. Encourage students to use their Tricky Code Cheat Sheets, 4 Commandments of Scope, notebooks,
   textbooks, classroom posters, and homework assignments.

3. Offer occasional time-checks to help keep students on pace.

4. Grade notebooks and review books in between helping students so students can keep notebooks for
   homework and studying in the evenings.


Accommodation and Differentiation
---------------------------------
In ELL classrooms, read all directions aloud before breaking into individual practice, and allow up
to twice the amount of time for completion of the lab.

- To save time on the rest of the lab, don’t spend too much time reviewing binary numbers, and
  restrict color exploration (Activity 2) to ~20 minutes.

- Use the tactile exercises as suggested on page 6 of the Teacher’s guide (candy exercise and
  exploring the digital camera).

As needed, allow students to pair up to help each other with reading comprehension (but remind
students that they each must submit their own code). Each day that you begin the lab, start with a
quick survey of student concerns and questions.

- Adaptations for group work can be found on page 19 of the Teacher’s guide.

Assessment questions have been relocated to the practice exam, WS 5.7.
