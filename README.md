Experiment: GitHub-Hosted Curriculum via Markdeep
==================================================

The contents of this experiment have been integrated into the `apcsa-public` repo, under
`lab/markdeep-curriculum`. This repo is left for the time being, as it hosts an early sketch of the
result, hosted from GitHub:

- [APCSA Curriculum Sketch](https://tealsk12.github.io/x-markdeep/curriculum/SUMMARY.md.html)

This repo is temporary, but hopefully the results will not be.
