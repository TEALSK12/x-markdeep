Experiment: GitHub-Hosted Curriculum via Markdeep
==================================================

The contents of this experiment have been integrated into the `apcsa-public` repo, under
`lab/markdeep-curriculum` in branch `steve/markdeep-curriculum. This repo is left for the time
being, as it hosts an early sketch of the result, hosted from GitHub:

- [APCSA Curriculum Sketch](https://tealsk12.github.io/x-markdeep/curriculum/SUMMARY.md.html)
- [`apcsa-public/lab/markdeep-curriculum`](https://github.com/TEALSK12/apcsa-public/tree/steve/markdeep-curriculum/lab/markdeep-curriculum)

This repo is temporary, but hopefully the results will not be.
